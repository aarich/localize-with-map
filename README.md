Localization
=================

Two main directories, one for creating a database map (CreateDB) and one for localizing within the database (Localize).

There are two directories, photos and kpd. photos are for photos and kpd are for keypoints and descriptors stored in yaml files.
The filenames for these must follow the same convention: `"x y z anglex angley anglez .yaml||.jpg"`
